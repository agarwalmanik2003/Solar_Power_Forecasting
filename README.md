# 🌞 Solar Power Forecasting using LSTM

This project implements a deep learning model (LSTM) to forecast solar power generation using inverter-level plant data and weather sensor data.  
It covers data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, sequence creation, and LSTM model training.

# 🔧 Steps Performed

### ✔ 1. Data Cleaning & Merging
- Removed duplicates and missing rows  
- Cleaned night-time zero-generation entries  
- Standardized timestamps  
- Output: **final_cleaned_dataset.csv**

---

### ✔ 2. Feature Engineering
- Added hour, day, month  
- Generated time-based patterns  
- Scaled features  
- Created: **X_sequences.npy**, **y_targets.npy**

---

### ✔ 3. LSTM Model Training
- Used stacked LSTM layers  
- Tuned batch size, learning rate, epochs  
- Performance:
  - **MAE ≈ 180**
  - **RMSE ≈ 230**

Model saved as:  
`models/solar_forecasting_lstm_optimized.h5`

# 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow
```

### Load and Use the Trained Model
```python
from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model
import numpy as np

model = load_model("models/solar_forecasting_lstm_optimized.h5")

X = np.load("X_sequences.npy")
prediction = model.predict(X[:1])
print(prediction)
```
